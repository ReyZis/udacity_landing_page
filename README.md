# Landing Page Project
- hello there! this is just a training project to test my ability of controlling the DOM by using JavaScript.
it is extremly simple to use this project, just drop the `index.html` file into your browser to open the landing page.
my JS code will automatically instantly change the layout so a list of section will appear in the top of the page, it will a bit hard to see it tho sue to its black color.
but hovering over the top of the page will be enough to make easier to see the nav menu.
by clicking any of that sections in the nav menu, the window will scroll all over to the chosen section.

- the function inside othe `js/app.js` file are well described, so normally you won't have any issues reading it.

- the `index.html` and `css/style.css` are provided by udacity's starter code so i don't have that much to say about them.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
